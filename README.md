# Yamori

Yamori is an application aiming to implement a real-world-level guest management system.

### Why am I building this application?


It is solely to learn comprehensive software engineering.

I will use TypeScript and Svelte for the front end, Go and Echo for the back end and MariaDB for the database.

<br>

This repository will be used to develop combined development skills from QA to performance tuning, including Docker, front-end and back-end development, database management, and testing.

<br>

Docker Compose to implement an application that can be deployed immediately.
