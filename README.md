## Why am I working on this project?

It is solely to improve my overall development capabilities.
This includes everything from bit infrastructures teritory such as Docker, DB, backend, and frontend development.
In addition, this is an ambitious project that aims to reach out to QA and performance tuning. (Yeah, I get it. I'm not a genius, so these things will be very challenging.)

Docker Compose to implement an application that can be deployed immediately.

I will remove old_ref dir ASAP. That is the rest of prototyping.
