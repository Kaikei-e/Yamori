# Yamori

Yamori is an application aiming to implement a real-world-level guest management system.

Why am I building this application?
It is solely to learn comprehensive software engineering.
I will use TypeScript and Svelte for the front end, Go and Echo for the back end and MariaDB for the database.
This repository will be used to develop combined development skills from QA to performance tuning, including Docker, front-end and back-end development, database management, and testing.

Docker Compose to implement an application that can be deployed immediately.
